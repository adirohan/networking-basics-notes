# What is the Internet?

The Internet is a global network of interconnected devices that communicate with each other using standard protocols.

In simple terms, it is a massive network of networks. Every time we browse a website, send a message, stream a video, or use any online service, our device connects to other systems somewhere in the world through this global infrastructure.

The Internet works using a common set of rules called protocols (mainly TCP/IP), which allow devices with different hardware and operating systems to communicate reliably.

## How It Works (High-Level Overview)

When a user opens a website:

1. The domain name is converted into an IP address using DNS.
2. A connection is established between the user’s device and the server.
3. The request is sent to the server.
4. The server processes the request and sends back the response.
5. The browser displays the received data.

## Key Components of the Internet

- End Devices (PCs, smartphones, servers)
- Routers and switches
- Transmission media (fiber, copper, wireless)
- Protocols (TCP, IP, HTTP, DNS, FTP)

The Internet is not owned by a single entity. It is maintained by multiple organizations, service providers, and infrastructure operators working together globally.
