# Types of Networks

Networks can be categorized based on the area they cover and the scale at which they operate. In real life, we use different types of networks depending on how far devices need to communicate.

## 1. LAN (Local Area Network)

A LAN is a network that connects devices within a small geographic area such as a home, office, school, or building.

Examples:
- Wi-Fi network in your house connecting phone, laptop, and smart TV.
- Office computers connected to the same switch.
- Computer lab in a college.

LANs are usually fast, privately managed, and use Ethernet cables or Wi-Fi for communication.

## 2. MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)

A MAN covers a larger area than a LAN but smaller than a WAN. It usually connects multiple LANs within a city.

Examples:
- A company with multiple office branches within the same city.
- City-wide government network infrastructure.
- Cable TV network across a metropolitan area.

MANs are often managed by service providers or large organizations.

## 3. WAN (Wide Area Network)

A WAN connects devices across large geographic areas — between cities, countries, or even continents.

The Internet itself is the biggest example of a WAN.

Examples:
- A multinational company connecting offices in different countries.
- Bank networks connecting branches nationwide.
- Cloud services accessed globally.

WANs use leased lines, fiber optics, and satellite communication to connect distant locations.

## 4. PAN (Personal Area Network)

A PAN is a very small network around a single individual.

Examples:
- Bluetooth connection between phone and earbuds.
- Laptop connected to mobile hotspot.
- Smartwatch connected to smartphone.

PANs usually operate within a few meters.

## 5. CAN (Campus Area Network)

A CAN connects multiple buildings within a limited area such as a university or corporate campus.

Examples:
- University network connecting different departments.
- IT park network connecting multiple office buildings.

It is larger than a LAN but smaller than a MAN.

### Practical Understanding

In daily life:

- At home → You use LAN.
- In a city government system → Likely MAN.
- When browsing the Internet → You’re using WAN.
- When connecting Bluetooth devices → PAN.

Understanding these types helps in network design, troubleshooting, and security planning.
